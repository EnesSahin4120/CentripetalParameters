Thank you for purchasing NWH Vehicle Physics!

For starters we strongly recommend checking out the documentation at http://nwhvehiclephysics.com, or the local copy of the documentation inside 'Documentation' directory.
The asset is complex and getting to know how it works will help down the road.

To get the look of the demo scene as seen in the promotional material go to Project Settings => Player => Other and switch 
from "Gamma" to "Linear" color space. Also, the demo scene using PostProcessing package from Unity which is not included for compatibility 
reasons. Used "PostProcessingProfile" is included with the asset.

If you experience any problems, errors or otherwise have questions about asset feel free to contact us at nwhcoding@gmail.com.
