The included .pdf files are an offline copy of http://nwhvehiclephysics.com.
It is recommended to use the website for documentation if possible.
Click on the question mark ('?') sign in the header of each editor/property drawer to open the documentation for that class.
If you encounter any issues with the documentation  contact us at nwhcoding@gmail.com.
Have fun :)
